# Product-Detail
Coding Challenge completed on 2/4/15 

All basic requirements have been met. The page is built using responsive design, and all of the data is populated with jQuery. There is an alert that fires if there is a '0' quantity selected when the user tries to add to cart. I have made the tabs for each category functional, but I have chosen not to populate them to ilustrate that they work and that the data will repopulate when selected. 

All of the information on the page in relation to the data is not hard coded and reflects what is populated by jQuery. The only non-functional items on the page are the pagination buttons and the 'select' element that specifies items per page.
